                            <p> Since there wasn't any text, I am going to assume that you wanted us to comment on the top ten designs of the week.
                                I personally thought that the designs were really cool, but I don't think I would implement most of them into my
                                website since I am a big fan of efficiency. Some of these designs would make the work flow (probably only slightly)
                                longer. Don't get me wrong, they're very cool! The first one I could see being implemented. </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I think I like the first design and the architecture design the best. They look visually appealing and don't really hinder
                                with user experience unlike some other ones. For example, the "AI Powered Assistant by Lubos Volkov" design makes the map really 
                                hard to understand.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> I personally liked: "Welcome screen / login by Andrej Radisic", "Cryptocurrency - Transaction Confirmation by Gal Shir", and
                                "Slider Concept for the Architectural Bureau by Alina Lichinitser for Ron Design" because they are able to look visually appealing without
                                messing too much with the user experience (like slowing down whatever process they're going through). The other designs would make the user
                                wait for the animation to finish before they can access something out. In the product world, that little time could make the difference
                                between a user wanting to use your app/website again or not. </p>
