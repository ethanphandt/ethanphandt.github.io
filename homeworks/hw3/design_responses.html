							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> The typography of a page may not be important to the reader at first glance, but a wrong font would look out 
								of place immediately. To get the correct font, one must identify their audience, look and apply inspiration,
								and experiment until a desirable outcome is reached. But also, it's important to play around with typography! It is an art
								within itself.

						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I really like the font size and type guide. Choosing fonts has always come down to whatever the default settings
								had... But there's so many other options out there that we can play with. Learning and playing with SKETCH was also very fun. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>

						</li>
